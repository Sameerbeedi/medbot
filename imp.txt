 Medication Reminders:

Data Storage: You'll need a way to store medication information (name, dosage, schedule) for each user. This could be a simple dictionary or a database depending on your needs.
Reminder System:
Use a library like schedule (Python library) to schedule reminder messages based on the user's medication schedule.
The get_response function can check if there are any upcoming reminders and send them to the user if needed.
2. Information Retrieval:

Data Source: Decide on a reliable source for medication information (e.g., an API from a medical database).
Information Retrieval Function:
Create a function that takes the medication name as input and retrieves information from the chosen source.
This function can leverage libraries like requests (Python library) to make API calls.
The retrieved information can then be formatted into a clear and concise response for the user.x
